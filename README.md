## Overview

### The Problem Statement

You operate a service and want to allow your users to sign in using Verifiable
Credentials from a mobile wallet. But building that takes considerable time and
expertise.

Additionally, you may need an easy solution to dynamically request additional
Verifiable Credentials from a user during a session (i.e., "incremental
authorization"). That would once again require a completely custom solution.

### The Solution

A service provider can run this dockerized bridge software that acts as a normal
OIDC Provider toward the service. That means any service supporting OIDC or
OAuth 2.0 for sign-ins can immediately be upgraded to accept sign-ins with
Verifiable Credentials. When setting up the bridge software, you can configure
what Verifiable Credentials are accepted and how the data within is put into
`id_token` or `access_token`.

As a contribution to Gaia-X infrastructure, the main goal here is to enable
users to use their Gaia-X Participant Credentials to access systems while making
integration simpler through the use of established SSO protocols. The bridge can
also be configured to use other Verifiable Credentials.

## Architecture

There are two main components to this project, as well as some additional
containers for monitoring and databases. A company (or at least a small
consortium) wanting to support SSI in their existing (or new) systems is
expected to run this full setup to avoid introducing a middleman:

```mermaid
graph LR
    client[OIDC Client<br><i>Some Service<br>at Service Provider</i>] <-- OIDC via HTTP --> Hydra[Ory Hydra]
    subgraph bridge[Bridge <i>at Service Provider</i>]
    Hydra <-- REST HTTP API --> vclogin
    Hydra <-- TCP / IP --> postgres[(PostgreSQL)]
    vclogin <-- HTTP --> redis[(Redis)]
    end
    vclogin <-- OID4VP + SIOPv2 via HTTP --> altme[Altme Wallet<br><i>on Smartphone</i>]
    subgraph home[End User Devices]
    browser[Browser<br><i>on Desktop</i>]
    altme
    end
    browser <-- HTTP --> client
    browser <-- HTTP --> Hydra
    browser <-- HTTP --> vclogin
```

_Note: In a deployment, external HTTP interfaces should be using HTTPS instead._
_Note: While we test with Altme Wallet, any SSI wallet supporting OID4VP +
SIOPv2 works._

### OIDC Provider: Ory Hydra

Hydra is a OpenID-certified implementation and FOSS. It should allow any OIDC or
OAuth2 client to leverage it as an IdP. For development, it has the advantage of
giving us the freedom to build a custom login process, as we can specify
arbitrary redirects.

### VC Login Service (vclogin)

This custom Next.js web app provides a user frontend for the login process, as
well as necessary backend API routes. It handles the Verifiable Presentation
exchange with the wallet, the verification of Verifiable Presentations and of
the Verifiable Credentials inside, and the extraction and remapping of claims.

## Login Flow

The user's browser starts out on the service website, which takes on the role of
an OIDC client here. The flow is slightly simplified for improved readability.
For example, the responses for Redis lookups are not shown. Also, redirects are
shown immediately going to the redirect target. This is an authorization code
flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
 autonumber
 actor User
 participant Browser
 participant Client as OIDC Client (Web Server)
    participant Wallet as Smartphone Wallet
    participant VPLS as vclogin
    participant Redis
    participant OP as Ory Hydra

 OP->>Client: Redirect to client callback with code
 Client->>OP: Get tokens using code
 OP->>Client: Return id_token and access_token
 Client->>Browser: Provide access to protected service
```

## Incremental Authorization Flow

Independent of an OIDC session, a service provider can request additional VCs
from a user. For example, this can be used to incrementally authorize a user to
interact with more parts of a service. An example is that users of a mobility
platform could, at any point in time, unlock the car sharing aspect by
presenting an additional driver's license VC.

From a technical perspective, the service provider backend initiates the request
by sending a login policy to a specific endpoint to create a temporary new
authorization endpoint within the bridge. This has the advantage of reusing the
bridge's existing verification and powerful policy system. A high-level flow
looks like this:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor User
    participant Wallet
    participant B as SSI-to-OIDC Bridge
    participant SP as Service Provider

    SP ->> B: POST /api/dynamic/createTempAuthorization
    B-->>SP: Return UUID

    SP->>B: GET /api/dynamic/getQRCodeString
    B-->>SP: Return QR code string

    SP->>User: Send Auth. page containing QR code

    SP->>B: GET /api/dynamic/getAuthResponse
    User->>Wallet: Scan QR code
    Wallet->>B: GET /api/dynamic/presentCredentialById
    B-->>Wallet: Return metadata
    Wallet-->>User: Prompt user

    User ->>Wallet: Select VC(s)
    Wallet->>B: POST /api/dynamic/presentCredentialById
    B-->>Wallet: Success

    B-->>SP: Return Auth Response
```

### API Documentation

This documentation provides all the necessary information to interact with the
dynamic API endpoints. The API is documented using Swagger, which provides a
user-friendly interface to explore and test the API.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> To access the Swagger documentation, you need to run the bridge in development mode and
> navigate to `http://localhost:5002/api-docs`.

To authenticate requests to the dynamic API in Swagger, you need to provide a
valid API key. The API key is stored in the `.env` file in the `vclogin` folder.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> To authenticate requests to the dynamic API in Swagger, first click on

## Running a Local Deployment

A local deployment is a great way to test the bridge and to use it for
prototyping an OIDC client service you are developing. Note that running a full
deployment requires the same steps, but instead of using a tool like `ngrok`, a
proper domain has to be set up.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need to use a tool like ngrok for testing so your smartphone

> (<https://ngrok.com/docs/ngrok-agent/changelog/#changes-in-22>). But you can
> manually replay that request on the ngrok interface, if you run into problems.

1. `$ ngrok http 5002`, which will set up a randomly generated URL
2. enter the domain for the vclogin service into the env file `/vclogin/.env`
   with key `EXTERNAL_URL`
3. enter a JWK key (Ed25519) into the env file `./vclogin/.env` with key
   `DID_KEY_JWK` (example for quick testing:
   `{"kty":"OKP","crv":"Ed25519","x":"cwa3dufHNLg8aQb2eEUqTyoM1cKQW3XnOkMkj_AAl5M","d":"me03qhLByT-NKrfXDeji-lpADSpVOKWoaMUzv5EyzKY"}`)
4. enter the path to a login policy file into the env file `/vclogin/.env` with
   key `LOGIN_POLICY` (example for quick testing:
   `./__tests__/testdata/policies/acceptAnything.json`)
5. OPTIONAL: enter an override for a credential descriptor into the env file
   `/vclogin/.env` with key `PEX_DESCRIPTOR_OVERRIDE` if direct control over
   what wallets are asked for is desired (example for quick testing:
   `./__tests__/testdata/pex/descriptorEmailFromAltme.json`)
6. to be able to test dynamic endpoint APIs, you need to provide an API key in
   the `.env` file in the `vclogin` folder with the key `API_KEY`.
7. at this point, it needs to be ensured that the container for the vclogin
   service is freshly built with the new env file:
   `docker compose down && docker compose build`
8. `$ docker compose up`

To validate the running bridge with a simple OIDC client:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> You might run into a "Permisson denied" issue when running the shell
> script `./test_client.sh`. You need to mark the file as executable using
> `chmod +x ./test_client.sh`.

1. `$ ./test_client.sh`
2. go to `http://localhost:9010` in browser
3. download Altme wallet and go through the setup process
4. to make sure you have a credential for testing, click on the "Discover" tab
   at the bottom and get a "Proof of email" credential
5. in your browser, click on "Authorize" and scan the QR code with Altme wallet
6. the wallet will prompt you with a list of possible credentials to present,
   from which you choose one and confirm
7. the wallet will show a success message
8. within seconds, the browser should redirect
9. end up at `http://localhost:9010/callback` with metadata about the login
   being displayed

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!TIP]

## Running for Development

Running for development means that all components, apart from the vclogin
service, will run containerized. The vclogin service can be edited and run
locally with hot-reload for fast testing and iteration.

If you are using VSCode, you may need to prepare configuration files to ensure
`eslint` and `prettier` work properly:

`./.vscode/settings.json` contains:

```json
{
  "eslint.workingDirectories": ["./vclogin"]
}
```

`./vclogin/.vscode/settings.json` contains:

```json
{
  "prettier.prettierPath": "./node_modules/prettier"
}
```

To develop the vclogin service, follow these steps:

1. `$ ngrok http 5002`, which will set up a randomly generated URL
2. create the file `./vclogin/.env`

```bash
DID_KEY_JWK=<Ed25519 JWK>
EXTERNAL_URL=<ngrok URL>
LOGIN_POLICY=./__tests__/testdata/policies/acceptAnything.json
PEX_DESCRIPTOR_OVERRIDE=./__tests__/testdata/pex/descriptorAnything.json
HYDRA_ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:5001
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
API_KEY=<api-key>
```

_Note: The PEX_DESCRIPTOR_OVERRIDE is optional and provides a way to override
the automatic descriptor generation._

3. `$ docker compose up --build`
4. `$ docker compose stop vclogin`
5. in `vclogin` directory upon first checkout: `$ npm i`
6. in `vclogin` directory: `$ npm run dev`

Now you can develop and it will hot-reload. For testing with a client, you may
refer to the end of the previous section.

## Running Tests

This repository includes unit tests with `vitest` and end-to-end tests with
`playwright`. You may run them as follows:

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:e2e
```

## Policy Configuration

The login policy is the one configuration file that configures the bridge's
behavior. The most simple example of one looks like this and accepts any
credential, while forwarding all subject fields to the `id_token`:

```JSON
[
  {
    "credentialID": "1",
    "patterns": [
      {
        "issuer": "*",
        "claims": [
          {
            "claimPath": "$.credentialSubject.*",
            "newPath": "$.subjectData",
            "required": false
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

A login policy is always an array of objects that represent expected Verifiable
Credentials. For each expected credential, we have to specify a unique ID used
for internal tracking. We also need to provide an array of pattern objects,
describing what the credential looks like and how its values are used.

A pattern object has the following fields:

- `claimPath` is a JSONPath that points to one or more values in the credential.
  If it points to multiple values, they will be aggregated into a new object and
  indexed by just their final JSONPath component. _This is generally convenient,
  but can lead to values being overwritten if not careful, and working with a
  credential that uses the same path components in different depths._
- `newPath` is the new path of the value relative to the root of the token it
  will be written into. This value is optional, as long as `claimPath` points to
  exactly one value. In that case, it defaults to
  `$.<final claimPath component>`.
- `token` optionally defines if the claim value ends up either in `"id_token"`
  or `"access_token"`, with the former being the default.
- `required` is optional and defaults to `false`

### Constraints

A policy pattern can additionally have a constraint field. A full policy making
use of this could look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "credentialId": "1",
    "patterns": [
      {
        "issuer": "did:web:app.altme.io:issuer",
        "claims": [
          {
            "claimPath": "$.credentialSubject.email"
          }
        ],
        "constraint": {
          "op": "equalsDID",
          "a": "$VP.proof.verificationMethod",
          "b": "$.credentialSubject.id"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

This example expects a verified Email from the Altme wallet and ensures that the
Verifiable Presentation is signed with the same key that is the subject of the
Verifiable Credential. That enforces a simple holder binding.

A simple constraint always consists of two operands `a` and `b` and an operator
`op`. The following operators are currently supported:

- _equals_ Strictly compares two string values. Takes two JSONPaths or a
  JSONPath and a string.
- _startsWith_ Evaluates whether `a` starts with `b`. Takes two JSONPaths or a
  JSONPath and a string.
- _endsWith_ Evaluates whether `a` ends with `b`. Takes two JSONPaths or a
  JSONPath and a string.
- _matches_ Evaluates whether `a` has a match for regular expression `b`. Takes
  a JSONPath and a string.
- _equalsDID_ Compares two DIDs or DID URLs by only their base DID. Takes two
  JSONPaths or a JSONPath and a string.

Sometimes, constraints may need to access fields from other Verifiable
Credentials in a Verifiable Presentation, or from the Verifiable Presentation
itself. For this purpose, we introduce two custom JSONPath roots:

- `$VP` is the root of the VP.
- `$credentialId` is the root of the Verifiable Credential mapped to the
  corresponding presentation.

Note that the `credentialId` refers to an expected credential, which can be seen
as a "role to fulfill" (e.g., any type of confirmed email credential), not a
specific pattern. Thus, a value that another pattern constraint refers to may
not always be there if the targeted `credentialId` has more than one pattern. In
cases where a constraint evaluation error occurs (e.g., unresolvable JSONPath),
the constraint returns `false`, but does not immediately cause the top-level
constraint to fail.

A pattern can only have exactly one top-level constraint object, but there are
logical operators that can combine multiple constraints:

- _and_ Takes two constraint objects `a` and `b`.
- _or_ Takes two constraint objects `a` and `b`.
- _not_ Takes one constraint object `a`

### Multiple Expected Credentials

The bridge supports multiple expected credentials in a policy file. This allows
for more complex scenarios where multiple credentials are needed to perform
authorization. An example of such a policy file is:

```json
[
  {
    "credentialId": "cred_email",
    "type": "EmailPass",
    "patterns": [
      {
        "issuer": "did:web:app.altme.io:issuer",
        "claims": [
          {
            "claimPath": "$.credentialSubject.email"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "credentialId": "cred_id",
    "type": "VerifiableId",
    "patterns": [
      {
        "issuer": "did:web:app.altme.io:issuer",
        "claims": [
          {
            "claimPath": "$.credentialSubject.id"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->

When having multiple expected credentials, it is possible to define constraints
for each as defined in [Constraints](#constraints). This is especially powerful
since it is possible to refer to other expected credentials:

```json
[
  {
    "credentialId": "1",
    "type": "EmailPass",
    "patterns": [
      {
        "issuer": "did:web:app.altme.io:issuer",
        "claims": [
          {
            "claimPath": "$.credentialSubject.email"
          }
        ],
        "constraint": {
          "op": "equalsDID",
          "a": "$VP.proof.verificationMethod",
          "b": "$1.credentialSubject.id"
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "credentialId": "2",
    "type": "VerifiableId",
    "patterns": [
      {
        "issuer": "did:web:app.altme.io:issuer",
        "claims": [
          {
            "claimPath": "$.credentialSubject.id"
          }
        ],
        "constraint": {
          "op": "equals",
          "a": "$2.credentialSubject.id",
          "b": "$1.credentialSubject.id"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## Token Introspection

Look into the Ory Hydra access token like this:

```bash
$ docker run --rm -it \
    --network ory-hydra-net \
    oryd/hydra:v2.2.0 \
    introspect token --skip-tls-verify \
    --format json-pretty \
    -e http://hydra:4445 \
    TOKEN
```

## Logging Configuration

### vclogin

The vclogin server uses the `pino` library for logging. Due to the peculiarities
of Next.js, http events are only logged for API routes.

### Ory Hydra

Hydra is set to a minimal log output. To expand log output, edit the `hydra`
service in `compose.yaml`:

```yaml
- LOG_LEVEL=debug
- LOG_FORMAT=json
- LOG_LEAK_SENSITIVE_VALUES=true
```
